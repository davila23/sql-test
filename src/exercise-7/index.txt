--  What methodology do you use to ensure your code is as efficient and scalable as possible? 


Below I detail some of the methodologies/good practices that must be used to guarantee good performance:

1) Good design and normalized.
2) Using indexes and foreign key constraints effectively to optimize performance and ensure data consistency.
3) Be careful when writing our SQL queries to avoid expensive and repetitive operations
4) Use of monitoring tools such as Datadog, which allows us to trace our requests and validate their performance.
